                        Privalytics.io collects data generated by the visitors to other websites. Therefore it is
                        crucial to be transparent regarding what data we collect and how we process it. In a nutshell,
                        Privalytics does not store any personally identifiable information of your users.

                    <h2>Do not track</h2>
                    <p>
                        If the user has activated the do not track option on his/her browser, we only store the time,
                        page visited, and referral, if any. By definition this information is completely anonymous and
                        thus cannot be regarded as tracking.
                    </p>
                    <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
                    <p>
                        We do not store the IP address of your users. We only use the IP address to calculate the
                        approximate location of your visitors if you opted in for that feature.
                    </p>
                    <h2>User agent</h2>
                    <p>The user agent is the information regarding the browser and operating system of the visitors of
                        your website. We only store the type of device used (i.e. mobile phone, PC, etc.), the browser
                        brand (Firefox, Safari, etc) and the operating system family (Ubuntu, Windows, etc.). By not
                        storing versions and build numbers we prevent storing any personally identifiable data of your
                        visitors.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Location</h2>
                    <p>We provide location information through <a
                            href="https://www.maxmind.com">https://www.maxmind.com</a> GeoLite2 database. In order to
                        avoid information leakage, we store the database locally and only keep the information of the
                        country of origin. This makes it virtually impossible to trace back the identity of a user based
                        on their location.</p>
                    <h2>Referrer</h2>
                    <p>If provided by the browser of your visitors, we store the referrer URL, including the domain and
                        path. In this way we can provide you with details of the provenance of your visitors.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Timestamps</h2>
                    <p>We store accurate timestamps of when the visit happened.</p>
                    <h2>Page & Queryset</h2>
                    <p>We store the page visited and the queryset provided. This enables us to identify the utm_source
                        and other keywords that may be relevant.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Screen dimensions</h2>
                    <p>We store the width and height of the screen of the visitors of your website. This will allow our
                        users to make smart decisions regarding the design of their pages.
